Introducing a new ThinkFirst News metric: “pxTA” stands for “Pixels To Answer” and it’s a measure of how many pixels from the top of the screen you need to scroll through to get to the point of an article.

Everything else, as seen in this Euronews article, is fluff intended for ads and videos.

It's important the pxTA is used wisely so as not to fall into the trap of a metric ignoring context. In some cases, the answer may require key context-setting so the pxTA may be artificially large. As we develop this unit, we'll learn more about how context can be captured.
