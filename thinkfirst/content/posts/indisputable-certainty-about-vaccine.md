Recently, the New York Times posted an article with a title whose premise in these panicked times is so tantalizing, the reader can’t restrain themselves from clicking.

Unlike your friendly neighbourhood fortune teller, who shrouds her lies with mysticism, the NYT is promising you guaranteed insight into the future of the coronavirus vaccine.

All they are asking in exchange for this extremely valuable and irrefutable information is your email and some personal information. What a bargain!

Where does this article rank on the shit-o-meter? Quite frankly, the article has good content, but is wrapped in hyperbolic packaging. Content like this frequently masquerades as free “information” when in fact it is neither. You provide your valuable personal data in return for “we’ll see”. Sounds as deceiving as what’s referred to in the fecal industry as the silent killer.
