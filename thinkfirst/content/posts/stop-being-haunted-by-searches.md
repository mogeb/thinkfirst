Looking up dubious information, like those forwarded Whatsapp messages from that one friend, is a healthy action to understand what is real and what isn't. However, simply searching on Google or YouTube may work against you in the future. These sites, like many others, will alter their recommendations to show you information similar to that you've searched. Even worse, they might place trackers in your browser to influence recommended articles on *other* websites. What you search for follows you around.

## Keep your information diet clean

There is a simple feature built right into your browser that can prevent your searches from following you around. It's called Incognito Mode (or Private Browsing)—and no it is not only useful for watching porn. Going into Incognito Mode will make your browser forget what you searched for and which websites you visited after you close it.

Here's how you can access it.

## Incognito is not completely anonymous

It's important to note that while your own browser won't remember what you searched for, this doesn't mean that Incognito is an extensive privacy tool. We won't dive into this here as privacy isn't our focus so you can learn more about what it can and can't offer from [this helpful article by Mozilla](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/common-myths-about-private-browsing).
