On April 25 we got reports from multiple sources stating the Kim Jung-Un might be dead, alive, or unconscious. The rush to report means that news needlessly gets reported without any clear confirmation. If something is unconfirmed, it should be clearly stated as [snopes.com](https://snopes.com) has done.
