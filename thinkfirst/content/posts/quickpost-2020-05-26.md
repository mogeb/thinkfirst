A pharmaceutical company press release is not scientific evidence. Last week, the media celebrated Modernaâ€™s successful COVID19 vaccine trial on 8 human beings even though it did not publish the test data. This keeps other scientists in the dark and protects Moderna from scrutiny. [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01092-3) leads the way with a good example of how to report such news and [On The Media](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/breaking-news-consumers-handbook-health-news-edition) provides guidelines on how to read such news.
