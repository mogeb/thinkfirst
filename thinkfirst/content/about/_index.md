Have you ever read a news article and wondered, "Who the *f* wrote this shit?"

We feel the same everyday. This project started off after a few discussions we had about the state of modern news. Every week we'll find the best zingers in the media and share them with annotations here. We're like two angry high school teachers giving naughty students an F on their report.
